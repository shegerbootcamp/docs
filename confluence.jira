# **CloudSheger Systems: AWS Commercial to AWS GovCloud Migration Guide**

## **Description**

This Confluence page provides a comprehensive, high-level guide for CloudSheger's migration from AWS Commercial Cloud to AWS GovCloud. The purpose of this guide is to ensure that all teams involved in the migration process have access to the necessary information and resources to facilitate a seamless transition. The document outlines key considerations, best practices, and steps to be taken during the migration, covering infrastructure, application deployment, database migration, and monitoring systems. It also includes contact points for team members responsible for different aspects of the migration.

## **Overview**

The migration to AWS GovCloud is a strategic move to comply with stringent government regulations while maintaining the high performance and reliability of CloudSheger systems. This guide provides the foundational steps and considerations required to migrate resources effectively and securely.

## **What is GovCloud? – The Backstory**

AWS GovCloud (US) is an isolated region of the AWS cloud, specifically designed to meet the stringent regulatory and compliance requirements set by the US government for sensitive workloads. This includes:

- **FedRAMP High**
- **DoD Impact Levels 4 and 5**
- **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)**
- **Export Administration Regulations (EAR)**

Due to these stringent requirements, physical and logical access to AWS GovCloud is restricted to US citizens who have been properly vetted.

## **Migration of Major Resources / Services**

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Approach**

CloudSheger uses **Terraform** for automating:
