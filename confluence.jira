# **CloudSheger Systems: AWS Commercial to AWS GovCloud Migration Guide**

## **Overview**

This Confluence page provides high-level guidance on migrating CloudSheger systems from AWS Commercial to AWS GovCloud. The purpose of this guide is to outline the steps and considerations necessary to ensure a smooth and compliant migration process. 

## **What is GovCloud? â€“ The Backstory**

AWS GovCloud (US) is an isolated region of the AWS cloud, specifically designed to meet the stringent regulatory and compliance requirements set by the US government for sensitive workloads. This includes:

- **FedRAMP High**
- **DoD Impact Levels 4 and 5**
- **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)**
- **Export Administration Regulations (EAR)**

Due to these stringent requirements, physical and logical access to AWS GovCloud is restricted to US citizens who have been properly vetted.
